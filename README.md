 Implementation of the proposed data science project will ensure an efficient approach for diagnosing and treatment. Combination of unsupervised learning, supervised learning, predictive analysis and causal analysis in right proportions to arrive at data-driven conclusions will promise a strong evidence to make informed decisions to produce precision medicine and transform the complexion of treating an individual. â€¨The project also fortifies a potential to generate huge volumes of data from various different sources that can also support clinical research for better medicine and to predict the future health risks of a community.
